# Advanced Selectbox

## Description

Advanced Selectbox is a jQuery plugin that cleanly displays the selected values from a select multiple box. It hides the actual input field and displays the list of values. Upon rollover of the container, the select box will appear allowing the user to update their selection. 

This was designed to overcome a filtering situation where there were a lot of select boxes on the page eating up a lot of unneeded space. Using Advanced Selectbox allowed me to double the values I could filter on without increasing any of the vertical realestate on the page.
